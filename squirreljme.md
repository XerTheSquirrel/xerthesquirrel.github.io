## SquirrelJME, a new Java MEÂ VM

 * Expected April 21, 2019

> SquirrelJME is a small open source Java Virtual Machine which provides an implementation of Java Micro Edition. It is a small, fast, and light JVM without the overhead of a desktop installation of Java. It also can run old J2ME programs which were created for ancient flip phones, this includes games and other software. This is a work in progress and as time progresses more software will be supported.
