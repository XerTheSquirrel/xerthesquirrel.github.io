# VisualVM NPS CPU Snapshot Dumper

 * [Repository](https://github.com/XerTheSquirrel/nps-dump)
 * Language: **Java**
 * Duration: About a week.

This project was a short term project that I used to learn about the VisualVM CPU snapshot format, essentially reverse engineering it and figuring out how the data is stored. I used the information I learned to create the profilers for [SquirrelJME](squirreljme.md) and [IOpipe](iopipe.md).
