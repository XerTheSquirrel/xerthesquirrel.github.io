# Trouble In Furry Land

 * [Repository](https://github.com/XerTheSquirrel/tifl)
 * Language: **C**
 * Duration: 5 days

Trouble in Furry Land was programmed in five days for a programming jam session. It was written in C since I had mostly switched to Java as my primary language (I prefer it over C because C can be quite messy).
